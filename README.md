This project displays a web page that I created with simple html and css. It contains a button to take a two-page survey about general personal information and transportation.

This web form first conforms to best practices as I have selected a background and font color combination that has an adequate amount of contrast and can be easily viewed, and passes WCAG 2.1 level AA standards. 

I have also applied an alt-text caption to my photo, indicating what is included in the photo as a brief description for people who may be using a screen reader. I have ensured all html is valid as HTML5, which further allows browsers to display my site correctly and therefore allow it to be read properly by a screen reader.

I also used autofocus, and have set up my form in a way that all form functionality is accessible from a keyboard. I also used a label on each text box, indicating what the survey question is generally about in order to make each question predictable and understandable.
